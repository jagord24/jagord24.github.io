Combining my passion for data analysis and coding, this [Python and Streamlit application](https://nflstatsapp.streamlit.app/) examines NFL team performance throughout a season. This tool is just the start to providing a sophisticated understanding of the ebbs and flows of an NFL season.
# Key Features:
**Interactive Chart**

Users can select an NFL team and season to visually assess the cumulative score differential across the entire season.

For a historical perspective, delve into the 2007 NE Patriots season below, a demonstration of absolute dominance. Then, for a contrasting view, compare them to my Jets, in any season, showcasing a different narrative of futility.

**Detailed Scoring Plays**

Complementing the interactive chart is a table presenting every scoring play involving the selected team from the specified season. This feature adds granularity, allowing users to view all of the moments that shaped their team's overall performance.

**Accessing the Application**

Explore the application [here](https://nflstatsapp.streamlit.app/) on Streamlit Community Cloud and dive into the world of NFL data analysis. I encourage you to take advantage of this tool, analyze the data, and share your valuable insights, feedback, or recommendations.

**Streamlit**

This project marks my first project using Streamlit, a tool I wholeheartedly recommend for its seamless integration of simplicity and powerful capabilities. Streamlit facilitated a smooth development process, but be mindful of the memory limit on the community cloud.

**Acknowledgments and Inspirations**

This project owes much to the extensive contributions of **nflFastR** and **nflverse**. Their consolidation and publication of NFL play-by-play data laid the foundation for this application. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/mrcaseb/status/1719345916107182093?s=12&t=oxRdxconaKCozNOR-cyAoQ) by @mrcaseb gave me the final push to get started on this.

The idea of analyzing score differentials over the course of games, traces back to a podcast discussion I encountered a few years ago. The concept of scrutinizing score differentials over the course of games has always interested me and eventually evolved into this project.
